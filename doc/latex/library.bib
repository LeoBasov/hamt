	abstract = {Since its first introduction, it has always been a subject of research to find models for a meaningful approximation of the highly accurate but complex Boltzmann equation. In the kinetic Fokker–Planck (FP) approach, a FP operator in velocity space is employed to approximate the collision integral of the Boltzmann equation. Instead of directly solving the resulting FP equation, a Monte Carlo technique is used to model an associated random process. This approach leads to an efficient stochastic solution algorithm. In recent years, the FP ansatz has become increasingly popular. Nevertheless, the modeling of gas mixtures in the context of kinetic FP has so far only been addressed in a very few papers. This article introduces a kinetic FP model that is capable of describing gas mixtures with particles interacting according to the hard-sphere collision model. The model is constructed to reproduce Grad’s 13 moment equations on a Navier–Stokes level of accuracy for gas mixtures with an arbitrary number of constituents. A stochastic simulation algorithm is derived that ensures a correct evolution of the species diffusion velocities and the species temperatures for a homogeneous gas, regardless of the applied time step size. It is shown that the proposed model is capable of correctly predicting shear stresses, heat fluxes, and diffusion velocities for different test cases, employing a He–Ar mixture.},

	abstract = {In this work we investigate the kinetic Fokker-Planck (FP) model [1, 2] concerning its applicability to simulate hypersonic, rareﬁed gas ﬂow. As in the direct simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) algorithm, the FP model simulates the stochastic motion of a set of particles through the computational domain which results in a simple coupling of both methods. No collisions must be calculated in the FP approach and so larger cell and time step sizes than by DSMC calculations can be used. Because of this, the FP model holds the potential to be more eﬃcient than DSMC where the Knudsen number is small. Further we present and investigate a hybridisation scheme for the FP and DSMC algorithms. We derive a non-equilibrium parameter from the Fokker-Planck- and Boltzmann-operator which indicates the validity of the FP model. In hybrid simulations this parameter is used to partition the computational domain in DSMC and FP regions. The particle motion is processed similarly in both regions, only the procedure for assigning new particle velocities diﬀers. To achieve an equal number of particles per cell, weighting factors depended on the cell size are used. The hybridisation scheme is tested for one-dimensional shock and two-dimensional cylinder ﬂows and gives results in agreement to pure DSMC simulations. An eﬃciency study shows, that the hybrid scheme is roughly ﬁve times faster than a pure DSMC simulation for a hypersonic cylinder ﬂow test case.},

	title = {Molecular {Simulation} of {Chemically} {Reacting} {Flows} {Inside} {Micro}/{Nano}–channels},
	abstract = {The  main  objective  of  this  thesis  is  to  study  the  fundamental  behaviour  of  multi–component gas mixture flows in micro/nano–channels undergoing catalytic chemical reac-tions  on  the  walls.   This  work  is  primarily  focused  on  nano–scale  reacting  flows  seen  inrelated applications;  especially,  miniaturized energy sources such as micro–fuel cells andbatteries.  At these geometries, the order of the characteristic length is close to the meanfree path of the flowing gas, making the flow highly rarefied.  As a result, non–equilibriumconditions prevail even the bulk flow and therefore, continuum assumptions are not heldanymore.  Hence,  discrete methods should be adopted to simulate molecular movementsand interactions described by the Boltzmann equation. The Direct Simulation Monte Carlo(DSMC) method was employed for the present research due to its natural ability for simu-lating a broad range of rarefied gas flows, and its flexibility to incorporate surface chemicalreactions.In the first step, fluid dynamics and the heat transfer of H2/N2and H2/N2/CO2gas mix-ture slip flows in a plain micro–channel are simulated.  The obtained results are comparedto the corresponding data achieved from Navier–Stokes equations with slip/jump bound-ary conditions.  Generally, very good agreements are observed between the two methods.It proves the ability of DSMC in replicating the fluid properties of multi–component gasmixtures even when high mass discrepancies exist among the species.  Based on this com-parison, the proper parameters are set for the prepared DSMC code, and the appropriateintermolecular collision model is identified.  It is also found that stream variables should becalculated more accurately at flow boundaries in order to simulate the intense upstreamdiffusion emerging at low velocity flows frequently seen in micro/nano–applications.  There-fore, in the second step, a novel pressure boundary condition is introduced for gas mixtureflows by substituting the commonly used Maxwell velocity distribution with the Chapman–Enskog distribution function.  It is shown that this new method yields better results forlower velocity and higher rarefaction level cases.In  the  last  step,  a  new  method  is  proposed  for  coupling  the  flow  field  simulated  byDSMC and surface  reactions  modelled by the species  conservation ODE  system derivedfrom  the  reaction  mechanism.   First,  a  lean  H2/air  slip  flow  subjected  to  oxidation  oniii
platinum coated walls in a flat micro–channel 4μm in height is simulated as a verificationtest case.  The results obtained are validated against the solutions of the Navier–Stokesequations with slip/jump boundary conditions and very good conformity is achieved.  Next,several cases undergoing the same reaction with Reynolds numbers ranging from 0.2 to 3.6and Knudsen numbers ranging from 0.025 to 0.375, are simulated using the verified codeto investigate the effects of the channel height ranging from 0.5μm to 2μm , the inlet massflow rate ranging from 5 kg/m2·s to 25 kg/m2·s, the inlet temperature ranging from 300Kto 700K, the wall temperature ranging from 300K to 1000K, and the fuel/air equivalenceratio ranging from 0.28 to 1.5. Some of the findings are as follows: (1) increasing the surfacetemperature from 600K to 1000K and/or the inlet temperature from 300K to 700K resultsin negligible enhancement of the conversion rate, (2) the optimum value of the equivalenceratio  is  on  the  fuel  lean  side  (around  0.5),  (3)  the  efficiency  of  the  reactor  is  higher  forsmaller channel heights, and (4) increasing the inlet mass flux elevates the reaction rateespecially for the smaller channels; this effect is not linear and is more magnified for lowermass fluxes.},

	abstract = {This paper is devoted to the algorithmic improvement and careful analysis of the Fokker–Planck kinetic model derived by Jenny et al. [1] and Gorji et al. [2]. The motivation behind the Fokker–Planck based particle methods is to gain eﬃciency in low Knudsen rareﬁed gas ﬂow simulations, where conventional direct simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) becomes expensive. This can be achieved due to the fact that the resulting model equations are continuous stochastic differential equations in velocity space. Accordingly, the computational particles evolve along independent stochastic paths and thus no collision needs to be calculated. Therefore the computational cost of the solution algorithm becomes independent of the Knudsen number. In the present study, different computational improvements were persuaded in order to augment the method, including an accurate time integration scheme, local time stepping and noise reduction. For assessment of the performance, gas ﬂow around a cylinder and lid driven cavity ﬂow were studied. Convergence rates, accuracy and computational costs were compared with respect to DSMC for a range of Knudsen numbers (from hydrodynamic regime up to above one). In all the considered cases, the model together with the proposed scheme give rise to very eﬃcient yet accurate solution algorithms.},

	abstract = {A kinetic model of the Boltzmann equation for non-vibrating polyatomic gases is proposed, based on the Rykov model for diatomic gases. We adopt two velocity distribution functions (VDFs) to describe the system state; inelastic collisions are the same as in the Rykov model, but elastic collisions are modelled by the Boltzmann collision operator (BCO) for monatomic gases, so that the overall kinetic model equation reduces to the Boltzmann equation for monatomic gases in the limit of no translational–rotational energy exchange. The free parameters in the model are determined by comparing the transport coefﬁcients, obtained by a Chapman–Enskog expansion, to values from experiment and kinetic theory. The kinetic model equations are solved numerically using the fast spectral method for elastic collision operators and the discrete velocity method for inelastic ones. The numerical results for normal shock waves and planar Fourier/Couette ﬂows are in good agreement with both conventional direct simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) results and experimental data. Poiseuille and thermal creep ﬂows of polyatomic gases between two parallel plates are also investigated. Finally, we ﬁnd that the spectra of both spontaneous and coherent Rayleigh–Brillouin scattering (RBS) compare well with DSMC results, and the computational speed of our model is approximately 300 times faster. Compared to the Rykov model, our model greatly improves prediction accuracy, and reveals the signiﬁcant inﬂuence of molecular models. For coherent RBS, we ﬁnd that the Rykov model could overpredict the bulk viscosity by a factor of two.},

	abstract = {Conductive stationary heat transfer through rareﬁed nonpolar polyatomic gases, conﬁned between parallel plates maintained at different temperatures, is investigated. It is assumed that gas molecules possess both rotational and vibrational degrees of freedom, described by the classical rigid rotator and quantum harmonic oscillator models, respectively. The ﬂow structure is computed by the Holway kinetic model and the Direct Simulation Monte Carlo method. In both approaches the total collision frequency is computed according to the Inverse Power Law intermolecular potential. Inelastic collisions in DSMC simulations are based on the quantum version of the Borgnakke–Larsen collision model. Results are presented for N2, O2, CO2, CH4 and SF6 representing diatomic as well as linear and nonlinear polyatomic molecules with 1 up to 15 vibrational modes. The translational, rotational, vibrational and total temperatures and heat ﬂuxes are computed in a wide range of the rarefaction parameter and for various ratios of the hot over the cold plate temperatures. Very good agreement, between the Holway and DSMC results is observed as well as with experiments. The effect of the vibrational degrees of freedom is demonstrated. In diatomic gases the vibrational heat ﬂux varies from 5\% up to 25\% of the total one. Corresponding results in polyatomic gases with a higher number of vibrational modes show that even at low reference temperatures the contribution of the vibrational heat ﬂux may be considerably higher. For example in the case of SF6 at 300 K and 500 K the vibrational heat ﬂux is about 67\% and 76\% respectively of the total heat ﬂux. Furthermore, it is numerically proved that the computed solutions are in agreement with the Chapman–Enskog approximation in a central strip of the computational domain even at moderately large values of the rarefaction parameter, as found in previous investigations. This property has been used to compute the gas thermal conductivity predicted by the adopted models.},

The approach is based on three kinetic models namely the Holway, Rykov and Andries models, as well on the DSMC scheme supplemented by the Borgnakke–Larsen collision model. Results are presented for the total as well as for the translational and rotational parts of the heat ﬂux and of the density and temperature ﬁelds in a wide range of the Knudsen number and for small, moderate and large temperature differences. The effect of the thermal accommodation at the boundaries is also examined for two diffuse-specular reﬂection scenarios at the walls. All three kinetic models provide results which are in very good agreement between them and they also compare very well with corresponding DSMC results. Comparisons with experimental results are performed verifying the validity of the simulations. The total heat ﬂuxes of diatomic and polyatomic gases have been found to be about 30\%–50\% and 50\%–75\% respectively higher than the corresponding monatomic ones, with the highest differences occurring in the free molecular limit. The translational and rotational temperature distributions (as well as the total temperature) are very close to each other for each set of parameters examined and they are close to the corresponding monatomic ones, when the translational and rotational accommodation coefﬁcients are the same. On the contrary they depart from each other when the two coefﬁcients are different. In most cases as the gas–surface interaction becomes more diffusive the dimensionless total heat ﬂux is monotonically increased. However, for adequately large temperature differences and sufﬁciently high gas rarefaction levels a non-monotonic behavior has been observed. It has been also found that in polyatomic gases the dimensional heat ﬂux is not necessarily increased as the molar mass is decreased, which is always the case in monatomic gases.},

	abstract = {The conductive heat transfer through rareﬁed gases composed by rigid rotators and conﬁned between coaxially placed cylinders maintained at different temperatures is investigated on the basis of the Holway and Rykov kinetic models as well as on the Boltzmann equation via the DSMC scheme supplemented by the Borgnakke–Larsen collision model. The translational and rotational parts as well as the total temperature and heat ﬂux distributions are computed and their behavior in terms of the gas rarefaction, the temperature difference between the cylinders and the ratio of the radii is investigated. The two kinetic models and the DSMC method provide results which are in good agreement for HS and VHS molecules. Furthermore, very good agreement with available experimental data for polyatomic gases has been observed at small and large temperature differences validating the implemented modeling. Qualitatively the behavior of the dimensionless total macroscopic quantities is similar to that of the monatomic ones. Quantitatively however, the heat ﬂuxes of polyatomic gases are signiﬁcantly higher than the corresponding monatomic ones. Also, as the amount of the elastic compared to the inelastic collisions is increased, the translational heat ﬂuxes are increased and they tend to the monatomic ones, while always the rotational heat ﬂuxes are about 50\% and 75\% of the translational ones for linear and non-linear rigid rotators, respectively. It is clearly demonstrated that heat transfer simulations through rareﬁed polyatomic gases in MEMS and other devices cannot rely on typical monatomic modeling. On the contrary, reliable kinetic modeling for polyatomic gases must be implemented.},

	abstract = {The simulation of gas and plasma ﬂows in the rareﬁed up to the continuum regime are of great interest to a multitude of applications ranging from atmospheric entry to electric propulsion. Large density gradients prohibit the use of a single method such as the well-established Direct Simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) method due to excessive computational requirements in the transitional and continuum regime. For this purpose, the Bhatnagar-Gross-Krook (BGK) collision operator is implemented in the coupled three-dimensional Particle-in-Cell and DSMC code PICLas. On the one hand, the BGK method oﬀers the advantage that collision processes do not have to be resolved in comparison to DSMC. On the other hand, the method can be readily implemented and coupled with an existing particle code. The ellipsoidal statistical and Shakhov target distributions are employed in the BGK method to achieve the correct Prandtl number through a modiﬁcation of the pressure tensor and heat ﬂux, respectively. The randomwalk Metropolis-Hastings algorithm is utilized to eﬃciently sample from the target distribution, where the acceptance-rejection method is not applicable. The method is also extended to polyatomic molecules. To verify the implementation, simulation results of a hypersonic, non-reactive carbon dioxide ﬂow around a ﬂat-faced cylinder are compared to DSMC results. Additionally, the computational requirements between the BGK-based models and the DSMC method are compared to demonstrate the substantial decrease in the required computational eﬀort for BGK.},

However, they both encounter difficulties when dealing with multiscale gas flows in modern engineering problems, where the whole system is on the macroscopic scale but the nonequilibrium effects play an important role. In this paper, we review two particle-based strategies developed for the simulation of multiscale nonequilibrium gas flows, i.e., DSMC-CFD hybrid methods and multiscale particle methods. The principles, advantages, disadvantages, and applications for each method are described. The latest progress in the modelling of multiscale gas flows including the unified multiscale particle method proposed by the authors is presented.},

	abstract = {With discretized particle velocity space, a multiscale uniﬁed gas-kinetic scheme for entire Knudsen number ﬂows is constructed based on the BGK model. The current scheme couples closely the update of macroscopic conservative variables with the update of microscopic gas distribution function within a time step. In comparison with many existing kinetic schemes for the Boltzmann equation, the current method has no difﬁculty to get accurate Navier–Stokes (NS) solutions in the continuum ﬂow regime with a time step being much larger than the particle collision time. At the same time, the rareﬁed ﬂow solution, even in the free molecule limit, can be captured accurately. The uniﬁed scheme is an extension of the gas-kinetic BGK-NS scheme from the continuum ﬂow to the rareﬁed regime with the discretization of particle velocity space. The success of the method is due to the un-splitting treatment of the particle transport and collision in the evaluation of local solution of the gas distribution function. For these methods which use operator splitting technique to solve the transport and collision separately, it is usually required that the time step is less than the particle collision time. This constraint basically makes these methods useless in the continuum ﬂow regime, especially in the high Reynolds number ﬂow simulations. Theoretically, once the physical process of particle transport and collision is modeled statistically by the kinetic Boltzmann equation, the transport and collision become continuous operators in space and time, and their numerical discretization should be done consistently. Due to its multiscale nature of the uniﬁed scheme, in the update of macroscopic ﬂow variables, the corresponding heat ﬂux can be modiﬁed according to any realistic Prandtl number. Subsequently, this modiﬁcation effects the equilibrium state in the next time level and the update of microscopic distribution function. Therefore, instead of modifying the collision term of the BGK model, such as ES-BGK and BGK–Shakhov, the uniﬁed scheme can achieve the same goal on the numerical level directly. Many numerical tests will be used to validate the uniﬁed method.},

	abstract = {For gas ﬂows with moderate and low Knudsen numbers, pair-wise collisions in the Boltzmann equation can be approximated by the Langevin model corresponding to the Fokker-Planck equation. Using this simpliﬁed collision model, particle numerical schemes, e.g. the Fokker-Planck model (FPM) method, can simulate low Knudsen number gas ﬂows more efﬁcient than those based on the Boltzmann equation, such as the Direct Simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) method. However, as analyzed in this paper, the transport properties of the FPM method deviate from the physical values as the time step increases, and this problem affects its computational accuracy and efﬁciency for the simulation of multi-scale ﬂows. Here we propose a particle Fokker-Planck algorithm with multiscale temporal discretization (MTD-FPM) to overcome the drawbacks of the original FPM method. In the MTD-FPM method, the molecular motion is tracked following the integration scheme of the Langevin model in analogy to the original FPM method. However, to ensure consistent transport coefﬁcients for arbitrary temporal discretization, a time step dependent friction coefﬁcient has been implemented. Several benchmark problems, including Couette, thermal Couette, Poiseuille, and Sod tube ﬂows, are simulated to validate the proposed MTD-FPM method.},

	abstract = {The large-eddy simulation (LES) model previously developed for cold flow in an axisymmetric ramjet combustor is extended to include a model for premixed fuel combustion. The combustion model explicitly uses a subgrid-scale local turbulent flame speed in the governing equation. This model not only reduces the computational effort, when compared to a model with detailed finite-rate chemical kinetics, but also avoids the potential error in the amount of heat release causd by numerical diffusion. Both stable and unstable combustion are simulated with evidence of decaying and growing pressure oscillations, respectively. The observed flow features on unstable combustion. such as a propagating hooked flame and its phase relation with the pressure oscillation, agree with experimental observations. These simulations clearly establish that the LES model contains the essential physics of combustion instability in a ramjet. Although the simulations show general qualitative features of combustion instability, further research is required to take into consideration the important effects of sub grid-scale turbulence on combustion instability. Extensive simulations using the resulting LES model may then lead to a better understanding of the physical processes involved in combustion instability.},

Diffusion  of  the  air  from  the  flight  speed  to  a lower  supersonic

In  the  flight  Mach  number  range  considered,  from  4 to  7,  the  over-

Baker, N.G.

The variance reduction, achieved by simulating only the deviation from equilibrium, results in a signiﬁcant computational eﬃciency advantage for low-signal ﬂows (e.g. low ﬂow speed) compared to traditional particle methods such as DSMC. In particular, the resulting method can capture arbitrarily small deviations from equilibrium at a computational cost that is independent of the magnitude of this deviation. The method is validated by comparing its predictions with DSMC solutions for spatially homogeneous and inhomogeneous problems.},

	abstract = {Vibrational–translational (V–T) relaxation is quite common in molecular nitrogen discharge non-equilibrium plasmas. In this paper, the energy relaxation in V–T transition is investigated by master equation modeling on all vibrational levels below the dissociation limit. The stateto-state transition rates are calculated by a forced harmonic oscillator (HO)-free rotating model. Meanwhile, the classic Landau–Teller model based on the HO of vibrational levels is revisited. First, the V–T relaxation in a heat bath is compared between the HO model, Morse’s anharmonic oscillator (AHO) model, and realistic vibrational levels by a direct-potential-fit analysis of spectroscopic data. The relaxation of average vibrational energy using the AHO model is faster than that using the HO model. Then, the influence of more frequent vibrational–vibrational (V–V) collision on the V–T transition in the heat bath is investigated by using different numbers of vibrational levels. The anharmonic effect is significant with more vibrational levels. Finally, the V–T energy transfer is modeled by a coupled solution to master equations and gas heating. The stronger the non-equilibrium between vibrational and translational temperature in the beginning, the larger the difference that can be obtained between the HO model (Landau–Teller theory) and realistic vibrational levels.},

The focus is on the evaluation of the vibrational energy production terms in the coupled symmetric-bending and asymmetric modes.

It is shown that a modiﬁcation of the Landau–Teller formula can be obtained from the rigorous theoretical expressions using several limiting assumptions. Whereas VT relaxation in the bending mode can be described by the Landau–Teller approximation with a satisfactory accuracy, its application to the inter-mode exchange requires introducing relaxation times depending on the vibrational temperatures of the modes involved to the transitions.},

	abstract = {In the standard implementation of Borgnakke–Larsen (BL) rotation and translation energy exchange in DSMC not every rotational mode of each molecule is active in every collision. In some collisions, the rotation mode of one molecule is “frozen” (cannot be changed by the collision); in other collisions the rotation mode of both molecules is frozen. Different relaxation rates are obtained by varying the proportion of frozen-rotation collisions. In 1974 Larsen and Borgnakke proposed a “restricted exchange” version of BL in which a portion of the energy of each mode is frozen in each collision; the method seemed physically plausible but did not satisfy the detailed balance condition. In 1978 Pullin proposed a general restricted exchange of BL exchange which did satisfy the detailed balance condition; it was more CPU intensive than the original BL scheme. It was seen as “laborius” and “cumbersome” and it seemed to be incompatible with vibration energy-exchange models. Here a simplified version, a special case, of Pullin’s restricted exchange scheme is described. The new method is only 12\%–17\% more CPU-intensive than standard BL methods and can be used with the standard DSMC quantum vibration exchange model. It is shown that the elimination of frozen-rotation collisions changes the high energy distribution of vibration energy in nonequilibrium conditions which may slightly decrease the nonequilibrium dissociation rate when restricted exchange is used with the quantum-kinetic method for dissociation reactions.},

	abstract = {It has been shown recently that the Fokker-Planck kinetic model can be employed as an approximation of the Boltzmann equation for rareﬁed gas ﬂow simulations [4, 5, 10]. Similar to the direct simulation Monte-Carlo (DSMC), the Fokker-Planck solution algorithm is based on the particle Monte-Carlo representation of the distribution function. Yet opposed to DSMC, here the particles evolve along independent stochastic paths where no collisions need to be resolved. This leads to signiﬁcant computational advantages over DSMC, considering small Knudsen numbers [10]. The original Fokker-Planck model (FP) for rareﬁed gas ﬂow simulations was devised according to the Maxwell type pseudo-molecules [4, 5]. In this paper a consistent Fokker-Planck equation is derived based on the Boltzmann collision integrals and maximum entropy distribution. Therefore the resulting model fulﬁlls the H-theorem and leads to correct relaxation of velocity moments up to heat ﬂuxes consistent with hard sphere interactions. For assessment of the model, simulations are performed for Mach 5 ﬂow around a vertical plate using both Fokker-Planck and DSMC simulations. Compared to the original FP model, signiﬁcant improvements are achieved at high Mach ﬂows.},

	abstract = {We present a generalized nonlinear Fokker–Planck equation, which describes the dynamics of rareﬁed monatomic gas mixture ﬂows. The devised kinetic model leads to correct transfer of energy and momentum between gas species and to consistent evolution of molecular stresses and heat ﬂuxes with respect to the generalized Boltzmann equation. Thus, the correct diﬀusion coeﬃcient together with the mixture viscosity and mixture heat conductivity coeﬃcients are obtained. The strength of the presented model lies on the computational eﬃciency, which is due to the fact that the resulting stochastic processes are continuous in time. Therefore, unlike in Direct Simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC), here simulated particles do not collide with each other, but move along independent continuous stochastic paths. Another aspect of the new Fokker–Planck model equation is that here the eﬀect of collisions is described via drift and diﬀusion type processes. Accordingly, a scheme can be derived for which the time step size limitation of the corresponding numerical simulation becomes independent of the Knudsen number. Consequently, this leads to more eﬃcient simulations, especially in low or intermediate Knudsen numbers. Results are presented for helium-argon mixture in a one dimensional geometry. The calculated mixture viscosity is found to be in accordance with experimental data, which reveals the accuracy and relevance of the approach.},

After a short description of the methods and their implementation, including the coupling concept for the LD-DSMC, simulation results of a nozzle expansion are compared with available experimental measurements and a DSMC simulation. Excellent agreement between ESBGK, ESFP, and DSMC can be observed in the throat of the nozzle, while the LD method fails to predict the correct velocity, temperature, and density profile. Further downstream, only the DSMC and the coupled ESBGK/ESFP-DSMC simulations are able to reproduce the measured rotational temperature profiles. A performance comparison shows the possible computational savings of a coupled ESBGK/ESFP-DSMC simulation, where a speedup of four orders of magnitude can be observed compared to a regular DSMC simulation.},

	abstract = {In this study, we propose a non-linear continuous stochastic velocity process for simulations of monatomic gas ﬂows. The model equation is derived from a Fokker–Planck approximation of the Boltzmann equation. By introducing a cubic non-linear drift term, the model leads to the correct Prandtl number of 2/3 for monatomic gas, which is crucial to study heat transport phenomena. Moreover, a highly accurate scheme to evolve the computational particles in velocity- and physical space is devised. An important property of this integration scheme is that it ensures energy conservation and honours the tortuosity of particle trajectories. Especially in situations with small to moderate Knudsen numbers, this allows to proceed with much larger time steps than with direct simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC), i.e. the mean collision time not necessarily has to be resolved, and thus leads to more eﬃcient simulations. Another computational advantage is that no direct collisions have to be calculated in the proposed algorithm. For validation, diﬀerent micro-channel ﬂow test cases in the near continuum and transitional regimes were considered. Detailed comparisons with DSMC for Knudsen numbers between 0.07 and 2 reveal that the new solution algorithm based on the Fokker–Planck approximation for the collision operator can accurately predict molecular stresses and heat ﬂux and thus also gas velocity and temperature proﬁles. Moreover, for the Knudsen Paradox, it is shown that good agreement with DSMC is achieved up to a Knudsen number of about 5.},

This is the joint probability density function (pdf) of the three components of velocity and of the composition variables (species mass fractions and enthaipy). The principal method described is to solve a modelled transport equation for the velocity-composition joint pdf. For a variabledensity flow with arbitrarily complex and nonlinear reactions, it is remarkable that in this equation the effects of convection, reaction, body forces and the mean pressure gradient appear exactly and so do not have to be modelled. Even though the joint pdf is a function of many independent variables, its transport equation can be solved by a Monte Carlo method for the inhomogeneous flows of practical interest. A second method that is described briefly is to solve a modelled transport equation for the composition joint pdf.},

The fully non-linear Grad's N×13-moment (N×G13) and Grad's N×26-moment (N×G26) equations for a gaseous mixture comprised of N monatomic-inert-ideal gases are derived. The strategy for computing the production terms (or Boltzmann collision integrals) associated with the moment equations for gaseous mixtures interacting with any interaction potential is presented. Employing this strategy, the explicit expressions of the non-linear production terms associated with the N×G13 and N×G26 equations are computed and presented for Maxwell as well as hard-sphere interaction potentials.The boundary conditions complementing the N×G13 and N×G26 equations are derived by extending the Maxwell's accommodation model for a single gas to a gaseous mixture. The moment equations and the boundary conditions are then restricted to binary gas mixtures and the linear stability analysis is performed to conclude that the Grad's 2×13-moment (2×G13) and Grad's 2×26-moment (2×G26) equations for a binary gas-mixture are linearly stable for both Maxwell as well as hard-sphere interaction potentials.Next, the 2×G13 and 2×G26 equations, specialized to Maxwell and hard-sphere interaction potentials, along with the boundary conditions are exploited to study some benchmark problems of fluid mechanics in simple geometries. The heat transfer in a binary gas-mixture confined between two infinite plates having different temperatures is analyzed with all four types of moment systems (2×G13 and 2×G26 equations, both with Maxwell and hard-sphere interaction potentials) and the results are compared with those existing in the literature. Furthermore, a one-dimensional problem of binary gas-mixture having one component infinitely diluted is solved analytically with all four types of moment systems in order to study the flow of the diluted component in the mixture.The numerical method based on finite differences for solving the aforementioned moment systems is demonstrated and employed to various problems in order to study the convergence of the numerical method. The convergence is analyzed for the above one-dimensional problems as well as for the standard two-dimensional problems of bottom-heated and lid-driven square cavities. The preliminary results on heat transfer for the latter two problems are also presented. However, the detailed comparison of the results with those obtained with highly accurate (particle based) methods is left for the future.Moreover, for model reduction, the Grad's moment equations for a binary gas-mixture with Maxwell interaction potential are regularized by employing the order of magnitude method and the regularized 17-moment (R17) equations for a binary gas-mixture with Maxwell interaction potential are derived; the R17 equations are third order accurate in the Knudsen number. The linear stability of R17 equations is analyzed and it is concluded empirically that the R17 equations are linearly stable for binary gas-mixtures with small and moderate mass differences while unstable for those with large mass differences.},

Based on Grad’s distribution function with 26-moments, we compute the non-linear production terms for a simple gas and a granular gas, and the linear production terms for a binary mixture of gases. The results can be shown for general interaction potential, but, in this paper, they are given only for hard-sphere interaction potential.},
